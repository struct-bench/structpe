### Once the eval pipeline is set, I want to run the vanilla pe model 

1. Get synthetic datasets of increasing complexity

Arrange in terms of fields: single field, two fields, three fields
The field right not is homogenous. All text feilds.
Two more ways of introducing complexity: make them hererogeneous, and make them more complex.
So, fields themselves can be more complex --> 

Bascially three axes:

1. Number of fields: composition of homeeneous 
2. Number of fields: composition of heterogeneous
3. Number of fields: recusrively complex

And then in terms of relationships between the fields:

Take a sentiment analysis dataset -- which is sort of multimodal -- in which certain columns clearly depend on others.
So, progressively complexify this. 

### Experiments to report under these experimental settings

1. Generate PE directly using 100 synthetic samples as the private dataset.
2. The vanilla PE description will specify the 

Experiment: What is it trying to show?

* Think about it. 
* In a sense structure is overdetermined even if you match similarity.
* So, the private dataset has to be confusing enough??
* What kind of dataset structure confusing
